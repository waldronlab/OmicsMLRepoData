# OmicsMLRepo project

Clinical and epidemiological data tend to explain most of the variation of 
health-related traits, and its joint modeling with Omics data is crucial to 
increase the algorithmâ€™s predictive ability. However, the nature of non-Omics 
data, such as heterogeneity, lack of standardization, high complexity, and 
loose links to Omics data types, make it hard to use both Omics and non-Omics 
data for ML analyses.

OmicsMLRepo project aims to build the first large-scale, platform-independent, 
curated, ML-ready data repository for diverse Omics and associated non-Omics 
data, starting from two Bioconductor data packages - [curatedMetagenomicData] 
containing human microbiome data and [cBioPortalData] package on cancer 
genomics data. We are also developing a software package, [OmicsMLRepoR], 
allowing users to leverage ontology in metadata search. 

In summary, the OmicsMLRepo project simplifies the process of cross-study, 
multi-faceted data analyses through metadata harmonization and standardization, 
making Omics data more AI/ML-ready.
